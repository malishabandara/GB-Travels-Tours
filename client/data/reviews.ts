I couldn’t have asked for more honestly! If you want to visit the island, Supun is definitely your man! Highly recommended",

Despite we didnt have enough time to travel around the island, thanks to our guide we were able to have adventurous experience and visit a lot of beautiful places. For anyone visiting Sri Lanka, I would highly reccomend to have Shaggy as you tour guide.",

      "Sri Lanka is spectacular. The country’s beauty from ancient architecture, diverse landscapes, and gorgeous beaches took my breath away. The people are one of the most warmest and welcoming ones you will meet. We had the opportunity to travel around Sri Lanka with GB Tours & Travels. We chose GB Tours & Travels because of their flexibility to arrange the tour according to our expectations. We found that other tours had a fixed number of places that you could travel to and were not willing to accommodate any other places we wished to visit. Mr. Supun (details mentioned below) created an itinerary for us including the places that we wanted to see. The attention to detail in planning including private transportation, accommodation and round the clock assistance, made our journey smooth and flawless. ",

      "Supun was an excellent tour guide and driver. On our second day in Sri Lanka he collected us from hotel in Negombo and drove us to Wilpattu wildlife park, where he stayed with us on the park tour acting as a translator and helper to the parks provided guide/ driver. This certainly made the park visit more enjoyable. On the return trip to Negombo Supun was happy to stop at several places along the roadside for us to try local delicacies. His English was good, and we enjoyed our conversations with him about Sri Lanka. He gave good advice as to good places to go further afield",
